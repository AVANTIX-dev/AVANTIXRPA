# AVANTIXRPA

Minimal scaffold for a Python-based RPA engine.

## Quick start

1. Install dependencies (at least PyYAML):

   ```bash
   pip install pyyaml
   ```

2. Run the sample flow from the project root:

   ```bash
   python -m avantixrpa.cli.main flows/sample_flow.yaml
   ```

Edit `flows/sample_flow.yaml` and add your own actions to start experimenting.
